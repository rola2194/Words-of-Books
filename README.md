###### The user can paste a book or any text, the program count every word and display the most commons on top. All puntuation get ignored, lower/uppercase go in the same bucket, and i would like to add a feature where many common books like "classics" are in the archive and also it is possible to compare and correlate books for words in common, for example: if the top 10 words for book1 are all about pirates, guns, and parrots we can associate book1 with another book with similar results, as i was searching the web this is not been done already and i find that could be a new way for books suggestion algorithms.
